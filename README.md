### Data Prep
All of the shot data was downloaded from <a href="http://moneypuck.com/data.htm">MoneyPuck</a>. Each season's file was initially treated in Excel before being bound into one of two files, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1IiUqVlKlmszVOWvlHiOUYf1X3ooIks/view?usp=sharing">training_set.csv</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JWUNobDbNl3Lc-M6KMRjIAakINqzObh_/view?usp=sharing">testing_set.csv</a>, that are cleaned further via <code>prep_data.py</code>.
