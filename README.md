### Data Prep
All of the shot data was downloaded from <a href="http://moneypuck.com/data.htm">MoneyPuck</a> in the form of distinct season files that received an initial treatment in Excel.

These separate files were then bound, or aggregated into one of two files that are cleaned further (via prep_data.py):
<ul>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1IiUqVlKlmszVOWvlHiOUYf1X3ooIks/view?usp=sharing">training_set.csv</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JWUNobDbNl3Lc-M6KMRjIAakINqzObh_/view?usp=sharing">testing_set.csv</a></li>
</ul>
